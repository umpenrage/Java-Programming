/* tuna++/-- is post-incrementing. Post-increment changes the variable after the JVM uses the variable.
 * if we were to change line 10 from --/++tuna to tuna++/--, then the with the current code JVM would output 5. However,
 * if we were to print it out again, then we would get 6. We can also use the assignment operator "=" to add and subtract numbers from each other
 * Ex. tuna += 8 <---> tuna = tuna +8
