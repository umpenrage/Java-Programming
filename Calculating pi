	/* I figured out a way to calculate the iterations. I thought at first to use the modulus statement using 'j % 4'. 
	* I thought this would give me the correct iterations because completion of the loop had j iterate +4. I felt this would 
	* give me the correct iterations because the modulus gives an integer. I see now that was a dumb idea because a division remainder can be any number.
	* The proper way to calculate iterations is using an incremental variable. To show this incrementation I used the variable 'i'.
