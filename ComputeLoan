		System.out.println("The total payment is $" + (int)(totalPayment*100)/100.0);	   	* because the at java uses the order of operations 
												    	* the '*100' in the second parathesis moves
		System.out.println("The total interest paid is $" + (int)(totalInterest*100)/100.0);	* the decimal place out 2 places and 
												    	* then cuts off the rest because of the '(int)'
												    	* command. Then we divide by '100.0' to change the number
												    	* back to double. This allows us to have 2 decimal points of accuracy.
												    	* which is the most accurate for money.
