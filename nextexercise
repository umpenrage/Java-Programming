/*
this program will determine whether or not a number is a perfect number meaning its factors sumed equals the number inputted

create input variable

prompt user for number

intialize sumVariable

call method getfactors

if 
sumVariable= number 
print out "Perfect Number"

else
	





int method getfactors

for loop 1 to inputted number(non-inclusive)

	obtains the factors for the inputted number using a for loop

	intialize int factor variable = number/loop controller variable
	
	call summation method with factor variable 

end for loop 

int method summation (factor)

	will add factors together
	sumVariable += factor
