#java-programming

Started out with the new boston, but I found his explainations lacking. Derek banas was great until his 8-10 videos. Afterwards, I was not able to follow his tutorials. I used the daniel liang text, but i found it to be more cookbook formulation. The problems tended to be quite difficult. Right now I am using Dietel's Java How to program. The rest of this Repository submissions will be dedicated to the 10th edition text, or if I happen to get the newer edition.
