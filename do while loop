 * the program would print out the counter, then check to see what the counter equals. 
 * Since the counter is not less than or equal to 10, the program will not loop. 
 * If you want to test something first, then you should use a while loop. 
 * If you just want the code to run first and then check a certain condition, then use 
 * a do while loop.
